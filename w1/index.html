    <p>     Hello! My name is <b>Ethan Carrera</b>, I was born in <i>Quito, Ecuador</i> and I am a middle child of three. I came to America when I was too young to remember Ecuador but I have dual citizenship in both America and Ecuador. My mother is an American citizen and born here while my father was born in Ecuador. They had my sister before they had me on May 21st of 2002. That being said I was raised in North Bergen New Jersey for most of my life. I went to North Bergen's elementary school that was also a middle school. I was there from 1st grade to 8th grade. I went to a vocational highschool named HighTech for computer science. I am now taking a game development course in New England Institute of Technology aiming for a bachelors. </p>
    <p>     Most of my life I have been into electronics. I'm a tech enthusiast and I've been such since I was younger. I built my first computer with my father when I was 7 years old. Since then I've loved electronics. I've been into videogames since I was 3 because it was a way for me to bond with my father and I felt closer to him playing videogames. </p>
